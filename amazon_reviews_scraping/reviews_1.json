(images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE\u2014It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS\u20141) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons\u20141) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT\u2014If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala", "helpful": "2,245 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Samsung-Galaxy-Midnight-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDRR?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 23 June 2019", "names": "Nishant Lala"}

I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be.

I am using this phone from last 4-5 days.The Samsung Galaxy M40 offers a refined design as compared to the other M-series smartphones from the company. It is quite compact despite bearing a 6.3-inch screen and lightweight to hold. The back comes with a gradient finish with edges reflecting the light blue colour, while the center is dark. This surely gives a premium look and feel to the device, which is particularly absent in other Galaxy M smartphones. This smartphone from Samsung comes loaded with Infinity-O display, which is present in the company\u2019s flagship series.Now comes to its reviewFor Gamers:If you are gamer then this one is best phone i play Pubg too much that works too smooth without any lags. this one is great on this phoneComing to camera: that primary camera comes with 32-megapixel camera and front camera comes with 16-megapixel camera. while videocall and selfies that gives best pictures. in day light the quality of camera is awesome.

This coupled with Live Focus delivers a good photo in daylight conditions and it looks quite natural in nature.Looks wise:Now comes to looks, looks wise this is amazing. i just love the look of this phone from backside that is really an amazing.Battery:Battery wise i just want to tell that this phone is just a beast that comes with fast charging.

{"starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "reviewTitles": "Excellent features and performance", "reviewerLink": "/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHPG3JUFPPU5I5NMAL7Y2K4SKJRQ", "reviewBody": "I bought the Samsung Galaxy M40 after careful deliberation and research. I wanted the latest cutting edge features and best configuration possible in my restricted budget of 20K. Below are my detailed observations regarding the features that make the Samsung M40 stand head and shoulders above any similar phone in the same price bracket. Many of these features were earlier only available on flagship phones at twice the cost and I feel Samsung has aggressively and effectively shattered the glass ceiling on budget phones with the premium feature packed M40. I will also try to provide detailed insight and my practical first hand experience with the M40's features while using it. I hope it helps you in getting a comprehensive in-depth understanding of the features.Looks, Feel and Functionality:\u25cf Infinity-O Display : M40 is the first Smart phone in this price range to feature the Infinity-O display which was only available in the flagship S10 series till now. This feature enables an expanded screen size with a screen-to-body ratio greater than 91% with FHD+ resolution by minimising the bezel even further, thereby providing a larger screen size without actually increasing the size of the phone. In fact the M40 has the thinnest bezel in the Galaxy M range. The uninterrupted mesmerising edge-to-edge experience actually makes the display look bigger than the phone you're holding in your hand.\u25cf Punch hole front camera : The infinity-O display provides the solution to create a cut-out in the upper corner in which the Selfie camera is discreetly tucked away, accurately placed while maximising screen real estate and maintaining the larger screen-to-body ration with the minuscule almost-bezel-less display. This is not distracting at all unlike the previous in-your face notch in the center and I felt it is really a great unobtrusive placement which lets you forget it's there till you use the front-cam. Again this punch hole design was previously featured on the S10 series and till now was a flagship phone feature.\u25cf Qualcomm 6xx series 2Ghz Octa-Core Snapdragon 675 with Adreno 612 GPU : This is the first M series phone featuring this latest 6xx Qualcomm 675 Snapdragon processor which has previously only been used in flagship phones. Simply put this processor super-powers the M40 for smooth, reliable and steady performance. It makes the M40 blistering fast with negligible app load times and allows brisk multi-tasking with numerous app loaded without any lag or delays. I felt the entire usage experience breezy, swift and snappy. The Adreno 612 GPU in combination with the processor handles the most graphics-intensive games comfortable without any slowdown or jitters that I could notice in games like Pubg and Asphalt 9 with its default setting of HD and High frame rate.\u25cf Triple Rear Camera Setup: The Samsung M40 comes with the best and latest in class combination on its cameras. The triple camera combination is more advanced than the M30 with its 32 MP primary lens which clicks pictures in really great clarity and detail and its f/1.7 aperture offers flexibility to get good shots in low light. It also features a 5 MP depth sensor with f/2.2 aperture for amazing portrait snaps and I've takes some of the most vivid pictures of my daughters with the M40 already. It also features an 8 MP ultra wide-angle lens with f/2.2 with 123 degree field of view for excellent reproduction while capturing landscape shots. The front camera is a huge 16 mp Selfie and video calling camera with vibrant results and the above combination is a first for the Samsung M series. The camera also features Slow Motion, Ultra Slow Motion, Hyper Lapse and video recording at the industry latest 4K quality. The M40 also features an AI based scene optimiser which gives outstanding results and sublimely attractive photographs. Focus locks quite fast and daylight shots are crisp and vibrant with colours quite close to real life optics.\u25cf Wide vine L1 and Dolby Atmos : One of the most under rated but beneficial feature in this time and age of online streaming is the strangely unknown Wide vine L1 certification that the Samsung M40 has. It is one of the rare phones which is certified and will stream popular streaming videos from Netflix, Amazon Prime and Google play in true HD quality. Most phones do not feature or advertise this and simply provide non-hd content even on their HD or 4K supported phones. Definite plus for me as I spend a lot of time streaming movies and binging on show and find the true-HD experience awesome. Dolby Atmos brings cinema quality surround sound and was previously engineered on Flagship phones and increases the audio/visual experience even for gaming.\u25cf On Screen sound technology : The M40 introduces the ground breaking futuristic On-Screen sound technology in the M40. The speaker is placed below the display effectively turning the entire display into a virtual speaker. This provides the benefit of saving speaker space thereby increasing the screen size and reducing the bezel further. The phone still needs to be placed in the normal position on the ear for best results and calling is crisp and clear in my experience when done so. This also translates into no speaker slot and grill to get clogged or damaged owing to daily use which is a nifty advantage for me.\u25cf Android Pie and OneUi : This is the first Samsung Device which features latest version Android Pie pre-installed ready to use right out of the box. The M40 runs on the OneUI which is Samsung's custom software based on the android 9.0 Pie update. The user interface comes loaded with a minimalistic design which is optimised for a smooth and simple user experience with tons of customisations that can be done. There is a system wide Night Mode, support for dual messenger and some nifty gesture based navigation controls and the UI really makes one-handed usage easier. Pre-installed apps can be uninstalled but most are useful.More Highlights, Features and Functionalities :\u25cf The Samsung M40 has a 6.3 inches FHD+ capacitive touchscreen with Corning Gorilla Glass protection.\u25cf At 7.9mm thickness combined with 168 gms weight in hand it is really lightweight and ergonomically designed.\u25cf Featuring 6 GB ram with 128 GB storage capacity expandable to 512 GB it takes care of all your speed and storage requirements.\u25cf Features Dual Hybrid sim slots for flexibility. Allows you to use 2 sim cards simultaneously or to expand storage using SD Card.\u25cf Has 3500mah optimised Lithium-ion battery which easily give you a day's backup with around 20% left at the end of the day if you have heavy usage like me or a day and a half's backup if you have moderate usage.\u25cf Good anti-glare visibility under sunlight owing to its 480 Nits brightness.\u25cf Incorporates facial recognition for unlocking along with fingerprint scanner built into the back which is snappy and fast.\u25cf Other sensors available on the M40 include Accelerometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Hall Sensor, Proximity Sensor and Virtual Light Sensing.\u25cf The M40 Comes with a 15W fast charger which takes around 1.5 hours to charge phone to full.\u25cf The M40 does away with the 3.5mm headphone slot and provides the future ready slimmer Type C earphones in box. The provided high quality earphones have crystal clear and crisp output and provide good immersive music experience.\u25cf The M40 has had a bundled launch with loads of network offers which you can benefit from, including savings of 3110/- on Jio Galaxy Club with its double data offer, or get 100% more data upto 840 GB for 10 months on Airtel or Vodafone Cashback worth 3750/- on 50 recharge vouchers of 75/- each along with 250 GB data with additional 0.5 data for upto 18 months.\u25cf The Company provides 1 year manufacturer warranty for phone and 6 months warranty for accessories in box from date of purchase.Downsides:\u25cf Samsung could have tried to squeeze in a bigger battery and it could have been a phone lasting 2 days.\u25cf There should be more colour options even in metallic finishes or a size variant.\u25cf Really need more options for protective accessories.\u25cf Samsung could have worked on IPS certification and made the phone waterproof.The Samsung M40 is a beautifully crafted mobile which looks both premium and elegant. The dark Blue hue with a gradient finish across the back of the panel blending into a seemingly lighter blue colour on the curved edges gives it a dual tone effect, making it look strikingly smart and sleek. The deadly combination of stunning looks with it's innovative and latest advancements and novelty features make the M40 quite a pleasure to own and use and in my opinion makes it one of the best budget smartphones under 20k.", "helpful": "9 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Samsung-Galaxy-Midnight-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDRR?pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 25 June 2019", "names": "Dennis James"}

The in box earphones sound good but feel quite cheap.The fingerprint sensor being a conventional one is fast and can also be used to swipe down/up the notification panel.The UI is quite good and smooth and also includes the dark/night mode which I really love. I increased the animation speed to 0.5x from developer settings which I usually use.The rear triple camera setup is just okay. You can get 32mp only in one mode and in that too pictures are not very clear. Although the front camera is quite good and can take pictures in portrait mode too. Before this, I was using MIA1 and I feel the rear camera of my 2 year old phone was better than this one. I just hope that the camera improved with future updates as the hardware is very capable and just needs a bit of software tweaks. I've seen in YouTube videos that you can install gcam directly which gives better photos .The battery is just okay and would harely last a day with moderate usage. It give a screen on time of around 4 hrs.For gamers, don't expect very high performance. For smooth running of PUBG, You will have to reduce the graphic settings. I didn't play any other game.The phone does not have an earpiece and instead uses some kind of screen vibration technology to produce sound.The display is just okay and you will face difficulty reading in open. The punch hole camera looks great and gives a premium look to the phone.You can get it for 19k using the bank offers.If you want a very premium looking smartphone with very good UI and a trustworthy brand but can compromise on battery and display(M30 gets a sAMOLED display at a lower price) go for it.Overall 7/10", "helpful": "9 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Samsung-Galaxy-Midnight-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDRR?pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 21 June 2019", "names": "Vishal G."}

It has an iridescent hue, a glossy, opalescent finish & an overall ombre effect. It is prone to scratches & fingerprints so best used with a case. It looks stylish & catchy even with a clear phone case.The Screen:It's a 6.3in crisp & vibrant display with saturated colors. There's a hole notch for the 32MP camera, but it doesn't get in the way. It's big enough but still easy to navigate. It's easy on the eyes & doesn't cause eye strain like LED displays. It's comfortable to view indoors as well as outdoors as it gradually adapts to the ambient light levels.The Weight:It's quite light for a phone of this size, weighing 168 grams, doesn't feel bulky in the hand.The Camera:Though there's no image stabilization & pictures taken in darkness don't turn out very well, it does very well in natural light, 4K recording and Super Slow-mo video recording. Pet pictures turn out especially good.The Software:Intuitive & minimalistic user interface with less bloatware that's more manageable by zipping unused apps.The Audio:The screen sound tech feels quite different as it subtly vibrates when the person's talking at the other end. The voices sound a bit different too, slightly hollow; which you get used to after a while. The max call volume is lower than usual.It doesn't have a regular earphone jack which leaves you with 3 options - to use type C earphones, wireless ones or use with an adapter.The Battery Life:A charge in the morning lasts a whole day on average usage. Also owing to the fast charging feature, it takes about an hour and a half to charge completely.So what's it like to be a daily user of this phone?It always looks refreshingly sleek & appealing. As you pick it up to use, it unlocks in a jiffy via face recognition or as you instinctively place your finger over the back sensor (as in subconsciously). Then you check your notifications or your usual routine, switching between apps seamlessly without any stutter. Apps launch quickly, the interface is smooth, and the phone doesn't get too hot when running simple chat and social apps. You'll be good for media consumption on it's huge display. All in all it's up for the task.IMHO If you are looking to buy a solid, mid-range smartphone that offers a large display for watching videos, has a decent camera and looks stylish, the M40 is worth considering. It's also great for people who's primary use is checking emails, social media & browsing youtube. Good looks & performance makes it an attractive option at this price point.", "helpful": "4 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Samsung-Galaxy-Midnight-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDRR?pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 18 July 2019", "names": "Talia"}

{"starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "reviewTitles": "Samsung Galaxy M40 - Most affordable phone with Amazing Specifications", "reviewerLink": "/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHWXQSULIVPO7LKRIP5OKT3F4EQ", "reviewBody": "Included with features like Qualcomm processor, a triple-rear camera setup, and Infinity-O display, Samsung Galaxy M40 is just at Rs. 19,990. Yet, is it any great? Go through to ready my complete review.A little while back, on June 11, Samsung launched its fourth cellphone in the current Galaxy M series, named the Samsung Galaxy M40.Performance and One UI of Samsung Galaxy M40In the Galaxy M40, Samsung has given Qualcomm's prevalent Snapdragon 675 SoC. The equivalent was additionally included in Galaxy A70, and M40 is the 2nd cell phone for Samsung to utilize the chipset. It comes with 128GB of internal storage and 6GB of RAM. The smartphone has hybrid SIM slot, which states you can either utilize one SIM card with a microSD card or two SIM cards (Nano-SIM+Nano-SIM).With regards to operation, the Galaxy M40 functions admirably in dealing with everyday works or even perform heavy various tasks. During my review, I didn't discover any stutter or lag. The Samsung Galaxy M40 is first M series smartphone come running Android 9 Pie-based OneUI. M series smartphones had Experience UI 9.5 and Android 8.1 Oreo in the past. So, it's a much-needed development. Most recent OneUI of Samsung is one the great Android overlay currently, and it functioned smooth as well. I discovered couple of missing features in the UI, which are available on Samsung's marginally premium cellphones. In the Galaxy M40, you can neither alter the presentation tone and nor do you have two taps to wake gesture. I am not certain, if Samsung, purposefully, left out those features.Going to the gaming on the Samsung Galaxy M40, the prominent high-graphic PUBG functioned good. By default, it happens on high-graphic settings. I didn't discover edge drops, the smartphone didn't warm much while long sessions and there was next to no load time. You can be rest guaranteed of different gaming performance also. Generally speaking, the processor and software mix functions extraordinary on the Samsung Galaxy M40.Design and Punch-hole display of Samsung Galaxy M40The Galaxy M40 is first reasonable smartphone by Samsung to offer punch-hole display. As I would like to say, it's the best style I've ever seen from Samsung in quite a while. The mobile fits and feels extremely brilliant in hands. This smartphone is very lightweight and I wouldn't fret the polycarbonate body over the metal or glass, if that holds the weight within proper limits.Upfront, you get a 6.3-inch full-HD+ TFT LCD Infinity-O or punch-hole display, which is bright and pleasant. The viewing angles, color reproduction, and touch response are satisfactory on this presentation. The bottom chin and bezels are genuinely negligible, and doesn't look bad. Additionally, the front camera punch-hole is exceptionally minor, and the general style and design resembles an excellent flagship mobile.Curiously, the Samsung Galaxy M40 is first ever cell phone to utilize \"On Screen Sound\" innovation. It means that there is no earpiece grill; and rather the whole display twice up as the speaker for voice calls. Sadly, it is not good innovation to be completely frank, in light of the fact that makes mild vibration and it doesn't feel great when you keep the ear close. Likewise, the result doesn't come comparable to the conventional speaker result. Having said that, it is as yet operational however you'll experience difficulties hearing in to the individual available on a call-in noisy environment.Battery performance, Fingerprint sensor and Face Unlock of Samsung Galaxy M40The Samsung Galaxy M40 packs a 3,500mAh battery with USB Type-C and 15W quick charging help. While I was writing my review, the battery backup of M40 was generally useful for the whole day. My utilization example can be contemplated as better than expected, however not incredibly high. It incorporated maps navigation, web surfing, social media apps, bit of video surfing, and web surfing. The mobile doesn't warm much and the battery doesn't get depleted too rapidly while navigating. I additionally observed the battery charging to be sensibly great, however not so quick. It for the most part took around 1 hour 45 minutes to completely charge the mobile from 0 to 100.Samsung gives a face unlock and physical unique finger impression scanner feature on the Galaxy M40. I observed the unique finger impression scanner to be somewhat irritable. The face acknowledgment is additionally very quick, yet at the same time opens with eyes-shut, which should be fixed for all Samsung cell phones.Camera Performance of Samsung Galaxy M40Like Galaxy A70, the Galaxy M40 packs a 3-camera lens setup at the back. It comprises of a 32-megapixel primary sensor with a f/1.7 aperture, a secondary 8-megapixel ultra-wide (123 degree) angle lens with f/2.2, and a 5-megapixel f/2.2 sensor for depth. Unfortunately, there is no Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), yet you can make video up to 4K at 30fps and 720p slow motion video-recordings at 240fps.I observed the camera of Samsung Galaxy M40 to be not too bad generally during my review. It would work well for you in many situations, particularly in sunlight. The camera adjusts saturation, high dynamic range (HDR), and colors great. The sunshine shots had great focus sharpness, however sadly passed up on finer details.This setup in any case works admirably and scene optimizer mode improves the result somewhat more for your preferring. On Galaxy M40, the 123-degrees ultra-wide-angle lens functions admirably, and the company has resolved the fish-eye impact problem. You can take enormous gathering shots or greater scene than any cell phone camera available in this cost.The Galaxy M40 utilizes a 16-megapixel f/2.0 lens for the front selfie camera, which is being placed on left corner of the display. It is very small and doesn't appear diverting on the display. Discussing its function, it captures great selfies and keeps the natural skin-tone. The 'Live Focus' bokeh mode gives you a chance to set the blur intensity, however the edge recognition isn't good.Should you purchase Samsung Galaxy M40?As I would like to say, the Samsung Galaxy M40 is one of the best mobiles in this cost. The mobile provides most recent punch-hole display, a modern style and an adequately ground-breaking processor for Rs 19,990. The camera experience is not the most powerful in its cost, however genuinely great in general. The smartphone is an enjoyment for gaming users. What it doesn\u2019t have is a 3.5mm audio port; however, Samsung gives USB Type-C earphones in the box. Be that as it may, I would even now call the Galaxy M40 a decent blend of software and hardware from Samsung, which didn't give me a chance to miss having a flagship mobile.", "helpful": "2 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Samsung-Galaxy-Midnight-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDRR?pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 11 July 2019", "names": "Akshay"}

Back is just glossy plastic which not only makes it slippery but is a scratch magnet. Glass is expected at this price point.3. TFT screen, while the lower priced M 30 offers the sAMOLED. So it misses out the \"Always on\" display. Maybe samsung was not willing to give the premium S series feature punch hole + sAMOLED display in this though they could have reduced the PPI. There are no options to change the color saturation also.4. Camera is not that great but not bad also. Just stands average. Fine with normal day to day photography.5. Battery backup is below average.

{"starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "reviewTitles": "Awesome!", "reviewerLink": "/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGQP5UFNEXIFJSHVS6MIWAMGJ4BA", "reviewBody": "Disclaimer: This is a layman review after 2 day use.Rating: 4.5 stars (rounded off to 5)Right of the bat let me just say that this is a marvellous phone! I have just ONE complaint and barring that, I would say this is the best in the market currently for this price.Let me start with what I consider the only con with this device - the call quality. How can Samsung get this wrong, I wonder. I had read this in a couple of reviews but glossed over it assuming it can\u2019t be true. Turns out, there IS some issue with the call quality- there is always some vibration sound which although not very discernible, exists. But here is why this particular problem doesn\u2019t affect me- I am always on handsfree either with Bluetooth or an earphone and so all my calls are routed via one of them and I get crystal clear clarity in both minus the vibration sound. It is only when I talk with the handset which is very very rare does the Zzzzzzzz set in. Not to say it affects the call clarity per se \u2013 you can hear the other side crystal clear- but it is annoying as hell. I had my mother use it and she did not find the vibration thingy irritating so I guess it may not be a universal thing. Either case if you use the earphone/headphone/Bluetooth/speaker then you won\u2019t face the problem but if you are entirely reliant on the handset then this can be a deal breaker.Now coming to the things I loved: Too many to list so I will keep it short.Firstly the look and feel is very premium. It feels more like a luxury segment phone than a budget phone. The seawater blue cover is breathtaking and unique.Amazing display. Everything looks sharp and clear.The camera is a joy to take pics with! Not sure why some reviews diss the camera quality- I found it pretty awesome.The battery seems decent. Could have been better but I have charged it only once these last 2 days and it is still going strong with average use.Last word: Samsung doesn\u2019t disappoint. Just wish the call quality was minus the vibration effect.

{"starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "reviewTitles": "Samsung Galaxy M40 Review : A Best Option Under 20K!", "reviewerLink": "/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGE3AW4675TDB6RV4EE6ZYJIAWUQ", "reviewBody": "Samsung has launched its M series phones 6 months ago and we have seen some of the best in class budget phones in the m series. Now with this M40, Samsung has leveled up their game in competition with the Chinese legends. The M40 has certain exclusive features to outrun its competitors. The Infinity O display, under display speaker and the triple camera setup are some of its highlighted features. I have been using this device rigorously for a few days, so do read my review till the end before you buy this phone.Before jumping into the review, let's see some of the technical specs.============= Specifications=============Display: 6.3 inches, 1080 x 2340 px, Infinity-O Display.Processor : 2.0 GHz, Octa Core, Snapdragon 675 chipset.RAM : 6GB (LPDDR4x RAM).Internal Storage : 128GB (expandable up to 512GB), Hybrid card slot.Software: Android 9 Pie, One UI.Primary Camera : 32MP (F1.7) + 8MP (f/2.2, 12mm ultrawide sensor) + 5MP (f/2.2, depth sensor).Front Camera : 16MP (F2.0).Fingerprint sensor: Yes, rear-mounted.Battery : 3500mAh with 15W fast charging.============ Box Contents============\ud83d\udce6 Samsung M40.\ud83d\udce6 15W Fast Charger.\ud83d\udce6 Type - C Basic Earphones.\ud83d\udce6 Sim Ejector Pin.\ud83d\udce6 User Manual.======= Design=======The M40 looks stunning in terms of design, Samsung has provided 2 colour variants on the M40, Sea Water Blue and Mid Night Blue. I'm a classic person, so I chose the Mid Night Blue instead of the Sea Water Blue. Both colours are great in its own style.The phone's body is made of plastic, but Samsung has managed to give a glass finish to the plastic body.The absence of 3.5mm headphone jack might be an issue for some users, Samsung has provided a basic type c earphone in the box for the wired earphones users. I mostly use wireless earphones, so with Dolby atoms, it's not a big issue for me.The fingerprint sensor is on the backside as usual. (We'll talk about the performance later in the review).The triple camera setup looks good and takes some impressive shots, Samsung has managed to keep the camera inside the body, though it does pop out a bit, but it's not an issue while keeping the phone on a flat surface. The ring around the wide-angle sensor does deserve a mention here, it looks good when looking at the camera.The Infinity O display looks amazing, it's a great improvement over the dewdrop notch and a regular notch. The punch hole is at a corner of the display, so it doesn't disturb the viewing while playing games or watching videos. I kind prefer this one over the other 2.Samsung M40 is a great phone in terms of design. I really like the Infinity O display.======= Display=======The Samsung M40 features a 6.3-inch FHD+ Infinity O Display with a 91.5% Screen to body ratio. I really hoped for a Super AMOLED Display on this, considering the lower priced M30 which comes with one. Even without a Super AMOLED Display, the display looks sharp with vibrant colours and has good viewing angles.The Widevine L1 Certification allows us to watch Full HD contents on Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.The display is clear and great on normal conditions, but we have to turn the brightness to full in order to get better visibility on direct sunlight.======= Camera=======Now let's talk about the camera. We have a triple camera setup on the rear. The first sensor is a 32 Megapixel with F1.7 Aperture and the second one is an ultra-wide sensor of 8 Megapixel with F2.2 Aperture, the third one is a 5 Megapixel depth sensor. I tried taking some indoor and outdoor shots with the M40, the camera performs quite good in outdoor conditions, but we can notice a slight lag in performance at indoor conditions.Now, let's talk about the front camera, on the front we have a 16 Megapixel camera with F2.0 Aperture. The front camera performs great both indoors and outdoors.The camera is good on overall basis, but Samsung does have to work on the image processing. It can be improved by updates.============ Performance============Now, down to the most important part. The M40 runs on a Snapdragon 675 processor, which is seen on most of the phones in this price range. The Snapdragon 675 is a powerful and efficient chipset. I've used the phone for a few days, I didn't feel any issues on day to day usage. I tried playing some Pubg with this and it's really great, the punch hole display is very efficient for games as the notch is at a corner, we get better visibility. The Snapdragon 675 is great for a day to day performance and can easily carry out any hard tasks.The One UI on top android pie is fresh and gives a good experience. Though regular Samsung users might miss some features from their old UI.Now, let's talk about the overall performance. The M40 has an under-screen speaker which works great for calls, the call quality is amazing. It also supports dual VOLTE. The fingerprint sensor works perfectly every time, but there's a slight delay which was improved after an OTA Update.On Overall basis, the M40 performs great for a mid-range phone. Though there is some small issues here and there, which can be improved over updates.======= Battery=======The M40 has a 3500mAh battery which sounds small when compared with the competitors who offer 4000 and some even 5000mAh. As I said earlier, the Snapdragon 675 is a powerful and Efficient processor which is efficiently pushing the battery upto its limit. The battery can easily last for a day or two on regular usage and can last for at least a day on heavy usage. The fast charger is pretty much quick to charge, I'm not sure about the exact time of full charge, but roughly it takes a little over an hour to fully charge the device.======= Verdict=======Finally, we are here at the end of the review. The Samsung Galaxy M40 is a decent phone in the mid-range segment and it is packed with some exclusive features to take out it's competitors. Though it does have some minor cons, but the pros far outweigh the cons. In my opinion, The M40 is a best option under 20k.", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Samsung-Galaxy-Midnight-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDRR?pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 5 July 2019", "names": "Jeron"}

Well, I must say I had my differences when it came down to mobile phone brands but I must say after this all-new M40 from Samsung I am reconsidering my choice in brands.The notable features that this phone has besides the very basic features are:1. It has a beautiful Infinity O display with a near bezel-free experience with a water drop notch.2. It has a mind-blowing speed because of its Snapdragon 675 processor.3. 32 MP+ 8 MP+ 5 MP TRIPLE CAMERA! And that too with 4k recording. Like wow!4. This phone has brought the notch up by introducing On Screen Sound technology where the sound is emitted from within phone and below the screen. This definitely upgrades the bezel-free experience.5. Also, it\u2019s Android Pie! And guess what's more impressive? It has NIGHT MODE!6. The best thing about this phone is it has got a Widevine L1 certification which lets you stream FULL HD content on any streaming networks. Oh and the Midnight Blue looks just so good.7. It has whooping internal storage of 128gb which again is expandable.8. And if you love to spend a really lot of time on your phone but at the same time keep worrying about a charging port nearby, this might be your ultimate phone of long battery life.9. It also has features like Device care, Data saving, Digital wellbeing, Panic mode, Dual Messenger and many more options to explore.10. It has got a very fast fingerprint sensor on the rear and a Face unlock system as well.The best sleek, good performance and brilliant display you can get at this budget.

{"starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "reviewTitles": "Extremely Stylish, Decent Battery, Average Camera - A Bundle Worth Buying!", "reviewerLink": "/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEI4UVCNN2V22VMWDPFRLT644RDQ", "reviewBody": "Samsung M40 is a premium phone with stylish looks, manufactured under \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative which is sure to turn many heads. However, this phone is typically meant to use in India and can be activated only via Indian SIM cards. The highlights of the product are detailed as follows:1) Quite Lightweight with Premium Looks \u2013 M40 is very light to hold onto and got a premium feel to it due to the sleek design. It is perfect for any occasion and would merge with any fashion statement. The seawater colour looks awesome and it got a unique double tone effect which will charm you up every now and then.2) Excellent Display with Thin Bezels \u2013 The display of the phone is excellent and outperforms any smartphone device I have held onto, till date. The ultra-thin bezels and high screen-to-body ratio make justice to the same. FHD videos on the phone look very detailed that other FHD screens and with time the punch hole camera will not bother you much; rather you will think it as a \u2018bindi\u2019 which beautifies your phone.3) Lightning Fast Fingerprint Sensor \u2013 The fingerprint sensor to unlock the device or apps works almost instantly as it is ultra-fast. The face unlock, on the other hand, is not that fast and will not work quite well if the hand-face coordination is not there.4) Fast Charging with Good Battery Backup \u2013 The charging of the M40 is quite fast and it typically charges 1% of the battery in less than a minute, thanks to the USB-C port. I have charged the phone from around 20% to 80% in roughly about 50 minutes. The battery backup on the phone is quite good, too.5) Average Camera Performance with Front Screen Flash \u2013 The camera of the phone works quite well but I have termed it average solely due to the hype it creates on the triple camera setup. I have, however, on particular occasions felt that the picture output is not entirely crispy as it should be with the smartphone these days. Although there is no physical front flash, the screen flash works well in low light conditions for a selfie. The selfie camera works well in normal lighting conditions.6) Below Average Ear Speaker \u2013 The phone\u2019s most hyped screen speaker (meant for talking over the phone) is sadly below average. I have had not got used to it yet and use headphones for phone calls. Other speakers, for loudspeakers or music playback, works like charm.7) Butter flow Performance with Apps, Minor lags with PUBG \u2013 Any apps I have used on this phone works like a charm without any issues, whatsoever. PUBG starts almost instantly and continues flawlessly for about half an hour while it starts to lag a bit. A quick restart will easily fix it, so, there should have been an option in the Game Launcher which would clear cache and optimize the phone for the game without the need to close the particular game.8) Unitive UI but Yearns for more Feature \u2013 The UI of the phone is very crystal clear and all the similar used settings are packed in unison. However, very basic features, like, displaying connection speed, LED notifications, or even IR blaster are something we expect in our smartphone these days.9) No Headphone Jack but USB-C Headphones Included \u2013 The 3.5mm headphone jack is missing to make in line with the classy design of the phone. Samsung thus provides with USB-C headphone which is quite good for music playback as well as phone calls. However, it would have been a bright idea on the part of the brand to provide with USB-C to 3.5mm connector, instead of a headphone which would ensure that all our previous headphones can be used with this phone.10) Indian Warranty Only \u2013 In this era of globalization, it is very hard to think that a multinational brand like Samsung offers an only local country warranty. I am honestly very disappointed at this approach from once a market leader.M40 has its own charm and definitely, a phone one would like to own. I have been quite satisfied with the buy due to its overall performances, so far.", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Samsung-Galaxy-Midnight-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDRR?pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 4 July 2019", "names": "iShahrukh"}

Cheaper phones have warm colour mode for blue light filter. OneUI on flagship models have a Screen Mode option, where you can set the White Balance slider to cool or warm. Although M40 has OneUI, there's no such option. I don't understand why. May be cost cutting. But how?_ On call voice clarity is bad. Especially, if you're outside in traffic, you will not be able to hear most of the conversation.Honest opinion - M40 is not really worth 20k.

I thought it would be a nice surprise given the much created hype around it. However, that was not to be! In a couple of days of use came about glaring lag in terms of innovation. This phone does not have an inbuilt app lock system which in turn meant one has to download a third party app to secure ones app. In other words one had to handover one's house keys to one's dubious neighbour and wish everything remained safe thats because one never knows what kind of data an application might gather once installed. Any which ways I did download an app locker app which- to my horror- when found inadequate refused to get uninstalled easily!!I had to read the uninstallation process thoroughly to get it removed from my device. An epiphany occured- getting a monkey off my back made no better sense than this time. Further, it had no ir port which is so very common in mi sets. this meant letting go a free universal remote. Camera- i see a lot of discussion happen around this thing in recent timws was average. battery was average. But the most annoying thing was the technology which professes that the sound comes from the surface of the screen. Its a dumb idea. the sound came as if some one had put on a plastic cover over a capable woofer in a common sound system. I can go on and on against this technology but in a single word for me this phone is a bad idea if you are an mi buff.Am ruing why i chose to experiment!!\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22i recommend an mi upgrade.", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Samsung-Galaxy-Midnight-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDRR?pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 30 June 2019", "names": "Shashank shankar"}

Rear panel of the phone looks similar to all M series phone, and you will find fingerprint sensor at the back.In the front you will get punch hole display that's the very new in market and only available with samsung M40 as of now.It features triple camera at back which gives awesome picture quality.New Feature is Screen Sound Technology which means the sound is delivered from under display which is basically done to reduce bezels.In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works great.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience.In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.BATTERY PERFORMANCE\u2014It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Overall a worth buy purchase and my recommendation for this phone are highly valuable for the one who is planing to purchase.", "helpful": "3 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Samsung-Galaxy-Midnight-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDRR?pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 5 July 2019", "names": "Shubham"}

First of all I'm not a Samsung fan or neither Xiaomi fan. This is my honest review...DESIGN : Design in pretty good and phone look premium in hands. And the gradient effect on the backside is really beautiful.SCREEN : It doesn't have super amoled screen. It is its biggest drawback. But TFT is fine...Just fineBATTERY : 3500 mah is not so low...Average user gets 8hr screen-on-time...PERFORMANCE & GAMING : This is the best part of this phone...I didn't felt any lag switching between apps or opening them...6GB ram is more than enough for multitasking and heavy gaming. I also played PUBG, ASPHALT 9, FORTNITE and ran without any noticeable framedrops.SOFTWARE & UI : Phone comes out of the box with Android 9.0.0 and One UI 1.1. I of the best thing happened to Samsung devices is the new OneUI. It is very simple, neat & Ad free. One UI also has some unique features compared to other UI.CAMERA : Even Samsung clam it has 32MP sensor image, quality is not so good...Images are not sharp enough...Front camera is ok...And video recording is just fine in 1080p at 60fps...It can also rec upto 2160pHeadphone jack is missing. But I don't care cuz today we mostly have Bluetooth speakers and headphones.Value for Money : Unlike other cheep chinese smartphones, It have good built quality and Ad free UI. One of the main reason why I didn't go with Redmi Phones is it have a lot of boltware and ads. Trust me that is ridiculous.

It should have been priced below 16500.This is why: I will start with the positives.* The phone is good to hold as it is sleek* It looks good because of the glossy finish and the punch hole camera.* It has 6gb of RAM* Samsung UI is good to use and gives some great customization options.* Responsive fingerprint sensor.This is why you should not buy this phone:* I am not happy with the display of this phone and you can see the image for the reason. The screen around the punch hole camera and the edges is too dull and seems like is not properly lit which instantly made me realize that going for Moto one vision could have been a better option. I filed a return after 3-4 days od usage however the inspection agent didn't find any issur with it. I am still not satisfied with that.* Poor camera performance. All the cameras are underperformers. Click pretty basic pictures and I was getting better or similar results from my previous phone- moto g5s plus. Doesn't suffice the reason of upgrading.* Face recognition is not super-responsive but does the job. You will not be impressed.* Battery drain is an issue. It will last a day with average usage. I avoid keeping the settings that drain more battery.* It has not even been two months and sometimes I see some lag while scrolling (facebook and even contacts at time). Scrolling is a pretty basic things a smartphone must be able to deliver but this one fails. (May be this is an issue with my device specifically)There is no point of asking for a return once you get the device as a service engineer will be sent at your place and they decide whether this will be eligible for a refund/return. So don't take a chance on that one.Overall, I am just ok with this phone as it has not amazed me yet.

Phone earpiece - you cannot listen to the caller clearly as the speaker is inbuilt so the voice is getting echo as well if you are standing outside roadside then for sure you cannot listen to the caller if its a traffic on road.2. No separate light sensor seems it is in inbuilt camera so it senses very late. If you pickup the phone in the night to see time your eyes will burn as the display is at highest brightness then suddenly sensor senses and lowers the brightness.3. the finger print sensor is useless. It only senses when the display is on. If you put your finger on sensor then it wont wake up phone.4. Sometimes you click on any voice note it will play in earpiece rater then speaker and till the time voice note finishes you wont be able to click anywhere else.5. Again the sensor now if you call someone and put the phone on ear the screen light closes and if the call gets connected its well and good and if it wont then you cannot call again bcoz the light sensor wont switch on the display so you need to press the power button to get the display and then disconnect and redial.Guys the above reviews are verified on one more unit of Samsung M40 only and i am really sorry for Samsung bcoz this Defective product launch shows Samsung is over confident about their products and their customers. Not a big deal soon some brand will capture their market like they captured Nokia before if they will do few more launches like this.My 20k went on a toss.

Please don't buy any Samsung phone.. They are making people fools..( due to one single scratch in the edge of the phone they are not claiming warranty )ContinuationAfter all the above story I gave my mobile in the samsung service center on paid service..These Samsung service people said me as expected the motherboard is corrupted due to intact damage so it needs to be changed(they said it costs around 10,500Rs).. I thought I can buy new one with some more extra money.. so I said them to not repair and I got it back... recently I watched YouTube and learned how to reset with keys.. my mobile got switched on.. and now I m writing the review with same phone..CONCLUSION:1.If you buy mobile buy hard case.2. Make sure you won't put any scratch on mobile to avail warranty.3. If ur mobile is not under warranty don't go to Samsung service center because they are literally looting people.. According to my experience I am saying this.4. As I saw many people were crying in the service center to pay the service fees which will be higher than your mobiles present cost.5.
