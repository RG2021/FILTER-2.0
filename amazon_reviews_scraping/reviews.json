Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.#thelongestreview?"}

Definitely yes.Pros:Light WeightBattery LifeCons:No 3.5 mm cable, only blue toothI was in search of a light weight wireless headphone that I can use for long hours. I have a Bose now but I cannot use it for longer than 2-3 hours as its heavy and ears and head start aching.This Infinity one wins there. I have used it for 6-7 hours without any aches or pains.The ear pieces do press a little on the ears unlike over-the-ear ones. This one is on-the-ear. But it is not uncomfortable and gives a good fit.The sound quality is good too. Noise cancellation is not big. With low volumes, you can hear surrounding noise.Battery does last for a long long time. I used it daily for 4-5 hours for about 3 days with one charge. Am truly impressed with it.And it folds, hence carrying it around is convenient too.And I got it in the lightning deal at 1500 Rs. Worth the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a non-expensive wireless headphones with a decent sound quality.I am giving it a 4 because I am not sure of its durability. If it lasts foe 6 months at least, then I will come back and update the rating to a 5."}

I bought it as soon as I saw it.These are for for people on a budget looking for a pair of decent looking and decent sounding headphones.I now use it for my daily use.For the price, this is absolutely amazing.It is a plastic build yet not cheap.a nice matte finish texture,with soft cushions, I have used it for almost 2-3 hours straight and doesnt hurt my ears.Also has three buttons( volume and power) a micro usb slot and infinity branding on the headband and the sides.As for sound its a 10/10. Doesnt get distorted on bass, no screeching on treble and nice smooth mids.Smooth criminal you can call it! I have tried house, RnB , Pop, EDM. Can hear all of em suppressed sounds we usually dont hear on cheap headsets.Double tap for Your assistant, quick response and the best part. Deep bass on Pressing volume up and down together.You cant expect the skullcrushing bass, like I said, you get quality bass which doesnt hurt you. Im a Bass head myself, i really love the bass delivered by this beauty because it is well balanced.Battery backup yet to be monitored, playing wellb for around 8 hours now on no charge yet. Sounding well, overall a premium feel. I had tried boat,boult,ant and those budget ones..Trust me this is the best Hands down.Superb job Harman, keep up the good work!"}

Excellent bass, delight to listen music on this headset.2. Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity is top notch..It's connects very quick after pairing.3. Handset Muff's are decently soft.4. Very less external sound creep in when u r listening on minimal volume. In higher volumes, u can't figure that.5. JBL quality sound. Minimal sound distortion in higher volume. 2 different base for unique listening. Very good value for basic listeners..6. Easily adjustable headset leaf so that it can be fitted tightly according to ur head size.# Cons:1. Build quality is basic. Its more of plasticky and looks normal. The turning hinges looks fragile. Till now, no problems faced, will update it long term review.2. Power on/off becomes a tricky function..It take more than 2 sec to power on/off..During power on, it starts syncing for new Bluetooth devices due to the prolonged time.3. Call voice quality is normal. The voice is very low heated from the other end.Apart from the above, the headset is value buy and its one of the excellent, branded headphone choice in the current market."}

Love to hear every single frequency from low to high and set my theatre for the same. Here comes the sound of this product it'll really produce the low frequency approx 80-100hz which is really good for such small speaker resulting good bass, clear sound with balanced trable.Noise cancellation is as expected. You'll be cut out from outer world.3. Bluetooth control and battery:Bluetooth is working as expected and can be achieved at a distance of 10-15 mtrs. Control buttons are good with proper sensitivity battery lasted 18 hours of regular use.Over all a nice product from Herman and can buy without having second thoughts."}

Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones."}

She is obsessed with Jason and Jess. She sees them through the windows of the train which she takes each morning and evening on her commute to and from London. The couple, whose real names are Megan and Scott, live a few houses away from the one Rachel used to occupy, before her alcoholism poisoned her relationship with her ex-husband Tom; who is now married to Anna and lives in the same house with their baby.When Megan goes missing, Rachel's world, which is already tangled, shifts even farther off-center. She finds herself unable to stay away, and winds up directly in the middle of the investigation, all while trying to deal with her growing addiction to alcohol and her frequent memory lapses.The point of view alternates among three women: Rachel, Megan and Anna although I would have liked one chapter on Tom. The writing is quite masterful as the writer gives away only enough with each chapter. Hence, this novel is perfectly paced, from its engaging beginning to its twist ending and is not an easy book to put down.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 5 March 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "3 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Girl-Train-Paula-Hawkins/product-reviews/0857522329?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

This has led me to believe that 2015 didn't have better books in the mystery and thriller genre, hence the Goodreads Choice Award going to The Girl on the Train.Now don't get me wrong. The book was a decent read - the beginning was so slow that I was about to dnf it forever; the onward journey to the first half of the book was what kept me going. And then, even though the author tried to end (almost) each chapter with a twist in the plot, the suspense was not strong enough to be maintained till the end, thereby making the joy of reading a mystery futile.I had set some expectations after reading the title and the blurb. Needless to say, those were never met. No sooner had the plot picked some pace than it turned out to be yet another murder mystery - the role of being that \"girl on the train\" was lost.What I liked was the character of the protagonist - a heroine with humanly flaws, an alcoholic who finds it tough to quit. The nuances faced by an alcoholic are vividly depicted - her thought process, the feeling of guilt, the promise to stop drinking and then doing the exact opposite the first chance she gets. Then again, the character of the killer did not get enough pages as it rightly deserved - I see a scope of lots of improvements there.Verdict: Pick if you are fine with easily being able to guess the killer.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 1 January 2019", "starRating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "3 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Girl-Train-Paula-Hawkins/product-reviews/0857522329?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

One day... she gets herself involved in a chaos of an house which leads to unveiling of unpredicted events.The first thing that I like about this book is the writing. It was wonderfully written and I was able to keep reading without any kind of confusion. The characters were limited and sufficient for the plot. There was no need for me to think hard and remember the characters. The plot didn't make me baffling as such but yes, it was unforeseeable.There was lot more than just crime and mystery in the book. There was love, compassion, family, strength, friendship, betrayal and more. I didn't feel that compromised as the hype for the book though.
