He only gives a catchy name to the chapter and keeps explaining the same words in a different way. He doesn't explain the psychological cause and effect of something.4.wrong perception about pickup artists community and the rejection game.5.The author doesn't know that each person has a different experience ,u bringing,pyschology we all Learn and Improve by different methods.few laws or habits cannot be imposed on everyone.I can keep writing cons for the book the list keeps going on so in shortThe only positive point to the book is that it is a good start for teenagers for red pill awareness.

May Disappoint - Dependent on Reader's Expectation.", "reviewBody": "The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.The book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.The chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.I was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.The hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy.

This book validates so.Ikigai is a short but not very short book based on a Japanese concept. According to this concept, we find the deeply sown purpose of our lives from within ourselves by defining our passion, mission, vocation and profession. It gives you tips as to how the simplest things in our life, like sometimes, taking a pause, are what will give us a long and happy life.I bought a hardcover because of it\u2019s extremely pretty cover. The cover itself will soothe your mind whenever you look at it. The title does go with the book but personally for me, not as I thought it would.If you are expecting it to help you find your Ikigai, give you step by step solution as to how you can find it and reward it with millions of dollars, you\u2019ll be disappointed. This book is full of facts, real life experience from Japan\u2019s Okinawa and compels you to focus more on you : your health, your choices, your focus and your inner happiness. It will probably be the only book you\u2019ll come across that tells you to take it, relax, but also burn in your passion.The language is as simplistic and beautiful as the cover and it\u2019s content. Not many tough words and very beginner-friendly in the reading world. The structure to is great with a prologue, 9 chapters, an epilogue and a list of more suggestions for you to explore in the end.Coming to the overall feel of the book, it\u2019s very cozy. In it\u2019s own way, it also does help you slightly to find your own Ikigai.I thought it would be a full on hustle kind of book but I felt relaxed after this read.

Indeed the key point that emerges from the book is that one should keep on moving and not spend most of the time of the day either sitting or lying down.It also dispels the notion that one should start withdrawing from the activities after one is officially retired and advocated that staying active is what would be the deciding factor if one aspires to complete a century on this planet- which incidentally is a Japanese quote from where the book starts. Does it not seem so pertinent in the times that we are living in- the Corona times. IKIGAI actually means living a meaningful life. Though Japan is a major rice growing country, the book advocates drawing from the patterns of food from people residing in Okinawa in Japan is that the food plate construct on a daily basis should be dominated by vegetables and Tofu, and there is a particular emphasis on the size of the plate. The plate should not be large, as we normally have in Indian conditions but it should be of medium size.However one may be hungry, one should aspire to eat 80% only which is called as Hara hachi bu in Japanese and were we to follow the maxim it would take care of quite a lot of health related issues that we are confronted with, associated with over eating.Interestingly enough Japanese have been practising the concept of saving called as Moai-where farmers get together to share best practices and also help one another with meager harvests. In the times of distress that the farming community is in the country, can we aspire to have such kind of a group of farmers. Farmers Producers Organizations have been formed but they need to converge to the concept of Moai to make it really effective.This group also had the provision of a monthly contribution akin the idea of SELF HELP GROUPS with a difference that the contribution is utilised for social activities and left over from the contribution is given a member based on his requirements.The book has tried to assimilate other such initiatives from around the world but the bottom line is that one has to find flow in everything that one is doing. There should not be any distraction or multi-tasking at all as it does not help anyway. To attain the flow, the authors have requested to adopt the policy of leaving the cell phones one hour before going to sleep, and one hour after getting up. Tough act to adopt? Each one of us has a passion inside us or the Ikigai and if we have found it we need to practice and fine tune it, and if not yet, it is incumbent upon us to discover it.NALIN RAI", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 9 April 2020", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Ikigai-Japanese-secret-long-happy-ebook/product-reviews/B073D36KNM?pageNumber=3"}

Also, I really feel sad to see my 75 plus mom in law and 65 plus mom to see sticking to bed and complaining that they are good for nothing now. I don\u2019t want to be one of these old women who can\u2019t rejoice life anymore, I wish to have both mental and physical strength in my old age too that\u2019s why I have entertained Yoga to my daily routine.The book starts with Japanese proverb \u201cOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years\u201d and it touches the art of staying young while growing old and also shares antiaging secrets. It also recommends to find flow in everything you doand master longevity. It gives a comparison of logotherapy of psychotherapy and prefers the previous. Apart from that, the book also tells the experience tales of centenarians as how they made it upto living longer and healthier life. The diet and exercise carry an essential ingredient in a perfect recipe of life.\u201cNana Korobi Ya Oki/ Fall seven times, rise eight\u201d is the key to remain antifragile and be resilient to deal with the setbacks. Follow the philosophies of Budhism and Stoicism which aim at practicing well being while you are enjoying life\u2019s pleasures. According to stoicism, we should be able to control our emotions and curb our ego and negative emotions.I even loved the \u2018wabi sabi\u2019 and \u2018ichi-go ichi-e\u2019 concepts which tell us that instead of looking for beauty in perfection, we should look out beauty in the given things-the things that are incomplete and temporary.Although the content on Yoga is something I just skipped because these were known facts and considerations.On the whole, Ikigai is a beautiful gift to the society. It leads you from darkness to light and follow a right path to healthy lifestyle. Worry less, Walk an extra mile and Weigh your burdens less. A good diet and some sort of exercise is needed to be added. Above all, everyone must have some purpose in life. It is the reason to live \u2018ikigai\u2019 and not anything else, which keeps you going.

May Disappoint - Dependent on Reader's Expectation.", "reviewBody": "The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.The book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.The chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.I was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.The hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy.

This book validates so.Ikigai is a short but not very short book based on a Japanese concept. According to this concept, we find the deeply sown purpose of our lives from within ourselves by defining our passion, mission, vocation and profession. It gives you tips as to how the simplest things in our life, like sometimes, taking a pause, are what will give us a long and happy life.I bought a hardcover because of it\u2019s extremely pretty cover. The cover itself will soothe your mind whenever you look at it. The title does go with the book but personally for me, not as I thought it would.If you are expecting it to help you find your Ikigai, give you step by step solution as to how you can find it and reward it with millions of dollars, you\u2019ll be disappointed. This book is full of facts, real life experience from Japan\u2019s Okinawa and compels you to focus more on you : your health, your choices, your focus and your inner happiness. It will probably be the only book you\u2019ll come across that tells you to take it, relax, but also burn in your passion.The language is as simplistic and beautiful as the cover and it\u2019s content. Not many tough words and very beginner-friendly in the reading world. The structure to is great with a prologue, 9 chapters, an epilogue and a list of more suggestions for you to explore in the end.Coming to the overall feel of the book, it\u2019s very cozy. In it\u2019s own way, it also does help you slightly to find your own Ikigai.I thought it would be a full on hustle kind of book but I felt relaxed after this read.

It talks about art of staying young while growing old, about relaxing, about not running behind materialistic things, how to improve your performance in daily routine and to stay focused.One of the best lesson which I liked was how to be more anti fragile. It talked about creating more options, by devoting time in your passion, taking small risks for increasing your experience and to get rid of the things which makes us more fragile.Before reading this book I felt that there would be some manoeuvre to follow for finding your ikigai, but there is just overview of many therapies which left me little unsatisfied and disappointed. There were few things like proverbs, quotes and traditions from centritains which I found were not really required. There is no rocket science written in this book but some of the facts are eye opening.P. S .

{"names": "Nalin", "reviewerLink": "/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFONRGGC2AIJIJ35YQIWWPV5DA6Q", "reviewTitles": "Be Slow and Things would fall in Place", "reviewBody": "The title of the book suggests that it is unravelling The Japanese Secrets to a Long and Happy Life, but it also does incorporate the key elements from Indian way of life i.e.Yoga and the Chinese way of life i.e. Tai Chi. Indeed the key point that emerges from the book is that one should keep on moving and not spend most of the time of the day either sitting or lying down.It also dispels the notion that one should start withdrawing from the activities after one is officially retired and advocated that staying active is what would be the deciding factor if one aspires to complete a century on this planet- which incidentally is a Japanese quote from where the book starts. Does it not seem so pertinent in the times that we are living in- the Corona times. IKIGAI actually means living a meaningful life. Though Japan is a major rice growing country, the book advocates drawing from the patterns of food from people residing in Okinawa in Japan is that the food plate construct on a daily basis should be dominated by vegetables and Tofu, and there is a particular emphasis on the size of the plate. The plate should not be large, as we normally have in Indian conditions but it should be of medium size.However one may be hungry, one should aspire to eat 80% only which is called as Hara hachi bu in Japanese and were we to follow the maxim it would take care of quite a lot of health related issues that we are confronted with, associated with over eating.Interestingly enough Japanese have been practising the concept of saving called as Moai-where farmers get together to share best practices and also help one another with meager harvests. In the times of distress that the farming community is in the country, can we aspire to have such kind of a group of farmers. Farmers Producers Organizations have been formed but they need to converge to the concept of Moai to make it really effective.This group also had the provision of a monthly contribution akin the idea of SELF HELP GROUPS with a difference that the contribution is utilised for social activities and left over from the contribution is given a member based on his requirements.The book has tried to assimilate other such initiatives from around the world but the bottom line is that one has to find flow in everything that one is doing.

Also, I really feel sad to see my 75 plus mom in law and 65 plus mom to see sticking to bed and complaining that they are good for nothing now. I don\u2019t want to be one of these old women who can\u2019t rejoice life anymore, I wish to have both mental and physical strength in my old age too that\u2019s why I have entertained Yoga to my daily routine.The book starts with Japanese proverb \u201cOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years\u201d and it touches the art of staying young while growing old and also shares antiaging secrets. It also recommends to find flow in everything you doand master longevity. It gives a comparison of logotherapy of psychotherapy and prefers the previous. Apart from that, the book also tells the experience tales of centenarians as how they made it upto living longer and healthier life. The diet and exercise carry an essential ingredient in a perfect recipe of life.\u201cNana Korobi Ya Oki/ Fall seven times, rise eight\u201d is the key to remain antifragile and be resilient to deal with the setbacks. Follow the philosophies of Budhism and Stoicism which aim at practicing well being while you are enjoying life\u2019s pleasures. According to stoicism, we should be able to control our emotions and curb our ego and negative emotions.I even loved the \u2018wabi sabi\u2019 and \u2018ichi-go ichi-e\u2019 concepts which tell us that instead of looking for beauty in perfection, we should look out beauty in the given things-the things that are incomplete and temporary.Although the content on Yoga is something I just skipped because these were known facts and considerations.On the whole, Ikigai is a beautiful gift to the society. It leads you from darkness to light and follow a right path to healthy lifestyle. Worry less, Walk an extra mile and Weigh your burdens less. A good diet and some sort of exercise is needed to be added. Above all, everyone must have some purpose in life.

Her lifestyle, her friend circle everything came to scrutiny during the First world war, where France labelled her as A Spy and a double agent for both France & Germany. Was she really a spy? or just a free thinking independent woman who was made a scapegoat during the most dreaded war?

The first 2 parts were in Mata Hari's own voice through her letters to her lawyer Mr. Clunet & the 3rd was in Mr. Clunet's own letters written for Mata Hari, a tricky concept which worked for this book.\u25cfThe story portrays brilliantly all the stages of Mata Hari's entire life from her childhood days in Holland to her first days in France when she was at the height of her succes and then also her last days when her name was demolished publicly.\u25cf It captures her love towards France, the very country which denied her very innocence, her so-called friends who deserted her in her need.\u25cfThe conception of love that Mata Hari coveted was so different yet honest but ultimately she couldn't understand the love of Mr. Clunet whom she accused of fighting her case half heartedly was heartbreaking.->Negative points-\u25c6The only one I could find was the story felt rushed sometimes, there were some gaps which if filled would have resulted in something as a perfect creation.Recommendation-I would urge every to read this book.
