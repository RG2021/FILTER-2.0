He only gives a catchy name to the chapter and keeps explaining the same words in a different way. He doesn't explain the psychological cause and effect of something.4.wrong perception about pickup artists community and the rejection game.5.The author doesn't know that each person has a different experience ,u bringing,pyschology we all Learn and Improve by different methods.few laws or habits cannot be imposed on everyone.I can keep writing cons for the book the list keeps going on so in shortThe only positive point to the book is that it is a good start for teenagers for red pill awareness.

May Disappoint - Dependent on Reader's Expectation.", "reviewBody": "The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.The book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.The chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.I was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.The hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy.

This book validates so.Ikigai is a short but not very short book based on a Japanese concept. According to this concept, we find the deeply sown purpose of our lives from within ourselves by defining our passion, mission, vocation and profession. It gives you tips as to how the simplest things in our life, like sometimes, taking a pause, are what will give us a long and happy life.I bought a hardcover because of it\u2019s extremely pretty cover. The cover itself will soothe your mind whenever you look at it. The title does go with the book but personally for me, not as I thought it would.If you are expecting it to help you find your Ikigai, give you step by step solution as to how you can find it and reward it with millions of dollars, you\u2019ll be disappointed. This book is full of facts, real life experience from Japan\u2019s Okinawa and compels you to focus more on you : your health, your choices, your focus and your inner happiness. It will probably be the only book you\u2019ll come across that tells you to take it, relax, but also burn in your passion.The language is as simplistic and beautiful as the cover and it\u2019s content. Not many tough words and very beginner-friendly in the reading world. The structure to is great with a prologue, 9 chapters, an epilogue and a list of more suggestions for you to explore in the end.Coming to the overall feel of the book, it\u2019s very cozy. In it\u2019s own way, it also does help you slightly to find your own Ikigai.I thought it would be a full on hustle kind of book but I felt relaxed after this read.

Indeed the key point that emerges from the book is that one should keep on moving and not spend most of the time of the day either sitting or lying down.It also dispels the notion that one should start withdrawing from the activities after one is officially retired and advocated that staying active is what would be the deciding factor if one aspires to complete a century on this planet- which incidentally is a Japanese quote from where the book starts. Does it not seem so pertinent in the times that we are living in- the Corona times. IKIGAI actually means living a meaningful life. Though Japan is a major rice growing country, the book advocates drawing from the patterns of food from people residing in Okinawa in Japan is that the food plate construct on a daily basis should be dominated by vegetables and Tofu, and there is a particular emphasis on the size of the plate. The plate should not be large, as we normally have in Indian conditions but it should be of medium size.However one may be hungry, one should aspire to eat 80% only which is called as Hara hachi bu in Japanese and were we to follow the maxim it would take care of quite a lot of health related issues that we are confronted with, associated with over eating.Interestingly enough Japanese have been practising the concept of saving called as Moai-where farmers get together to share best practices and also help one another with meager harvests. In the times of distress that the farming community is in the country, can we aspire to have such kind of a group of farmers. Farmers Producers Organizations have been formed but they need to converge to the concept of Moai to make it really effective.This group also had the provision of a monthly contribution akin the idea of SELF HELP GROUPS with a difference that the contribution is utilised for social activities and left over from the contribution is given a member based on his requirements.The book has tried to assimilate other such initiatives from around the world but the bottom line is that one has to find flow in everything that one is doing. There should not be any distraction or multi-tasking at all as it does not help anyway. To attain the flow, the authors have requested to adopt the policy of leaving the cell phones one hour before going to sleep, and one hour after getting up. Tough act to adopt? Each one of us has a passion inside us or the Ikigai and if we have found it we need to practice and fine tune it, and if not yet, it is incumbent upon us to discover it.NALIN RAI", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 9 April 2020", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Ikigai-Japanese-secret-long-happy-ebook/product-reviews/B073D36KNM?pageNumber=3"}

Also, I really feel sad to see my 75 plus mom in law and 65 plus mom to see sticking to bed and complaining that they are good for nothing now. I don\u2019t want to be one of these old women who can\u2019t rejoice life anymore, I wish to have both mental and physical strength in my old age too that\u2019s why I have entertained Yoga to my daily routine.The book starts with Japanese proverb \u201cOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years\u201d and it touches the art of staying young while growing old and also shares antiaging secrets. It also recommends to find flow in everything you doand master longevity. It gives a comparison of logotherapy of psychotherapy and prefers the previous. Apart from that, the book also tells the experience tales of centenarians as how they made it upto living longer and healthier life. The diet and exercise carry an essential ingredient in a perfect recipe of life.\u201cNana Korobi Ya Oki/ Fall seven times, rise eight\u201d is the key to remain antifragile and be resilient to deal with the setbacks. Follow the philosophies of Budhism and Stoicism which aim at practicing well being while you are enjoying life\u2019s pleasures. According to stoicism, we should be able to control our emotions and curb our ego and negative emotions.I even loved the \u2018wabi sabi\u2019 and \u2018ichi-go ichi-e\u2019 concepts which tell us that instead of looking for beauty in perfection, we should look out beauty in the given things-the things that are incomplete and temporary.Although the content on Yoga is something I just skipped because these were known facts and considerations.On the whole, Ikigai is a beautiful gift to the society. It leads you from darkness to light and follow a right path to healthy lifestyle. Worry less, Walk an extra mile and Weigh your burdens less. A good diet and some sort of exercise is needed to be added. Above all, everyone must have some purpose in life. It is the reason to live \u2018ikigai\u2019 and not anything else, which keeps you going.

May Disappoint - Dependent on Reader's Expectation.", "reviewBody": "The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.The book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.The chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.I was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.The hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy.

This book validates so.Ikigai is a short but not very short book based on a Japanese concept. According to this concept, we find the deeply sown purpose of our lives from within ourselves by defining our passion, mission, vocation and profession. It gives you tips as to how the simplest things in our life, like sometimes, taking a pause, are what will give us a long and happy life.I bought a hardcover because of it\u2019s extremely pretty cover. The cover itself will soothe your mind whenever you look at it. The title does go with the book but personally for me, not as I thought it would.If you are expecting it to help you find your Ikigai, give you step by step solution as to how you can find it and reward it with millions of dollars, you\u2019ll be disappointed. This book is full of facts, real life experience from Japan\u2019s Okinawa and compels you to focus more on you : your health, your choices, your focus and your inner happiness. It will probably be the only book you\u2019ll come across that tells you to take it, relax, but also burn in your passion.The language is as simplistic and beautiful as the cover and it\u2019s content. Not many tough words and very beginner-friendly in the reading world. The structure to is great with a prologue, 9 chapters, an epilogue and a list of more suggestions for you to explore in the end.Coming to the overall feel of the book, it\u2019s very cozy. In it\u2019s own way, it also does help you slightly to find your own Ikigai.I thought it would be a full on hustle kind of book but I felt relaxed after this read.

It talks about art of staying young while growing old, about relaxing, about not running behind materialistic things, how to improve your performance in daily routine and to stay focused.One of the best lesson which I liked was how to be more anti fragile. It talked about creating more options, by devoting time in your passion, taking small risks for increasing your experience and to get rid of the things which makes us more fragile.Before reading this book I felt that there would be some manoeuvre to follow for finding your ikigai, but there is just overview of many therapies which left me little unsatisfied and disappointed. There were few things like proverbs, quotes and traditions from centritains which I found were not really required. There is no rocket science written in this book but some of the facts are eye opening.P. S .

{"names": "Nalin", "reviewerLink": "/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFONRGGC2AIJIJ35YQIWWPV5DA6Q", "reviewTitles": "Be Slow and Things would fall in Place", "reviewBody": "The title of the book suggests that it is unravelling The Japanese Secrets to a Long and Happy Life, but it also does incorporate the key elements from Indian way of life i.e.Yoga and the Chinese way of life i.e. Tai Chi. Indeed the key point that emerges from the book is that one should keep on moving and not spend most of the time of the day either sitting or lying down.It also dispels the notion that one should start withdrawing from the activities after one is officially retired and advocated that staying active is what would be the deciding factor if one aspires to complete a century on this planet- which incidentally is a Japanese quote from where the book starts. Does it not seem so pertinent in the times that we are living in- the Corona times. IKIGAI actually means living a meaningful life. Though Japan is a major rice growing country, the book advocates drawing from the patterns of food from people residing in Okinawa in Japan is that the food plate construct on a daily basis should be dominated by vegetables and Tofu, and there is a particular emphasis on the size of the plate. The plate should not be large, as we normally have in Indian conditions but it should be of medium size.However one may be hungry, one should aspire to eat 80% only which is called as Hara hachi bu in Japanese and were we to follow the maxim it would take care of quite a lot of health related issues that we are confronted with, associated with over eating.Interestingly enough Japanese have been practising the concept of saving called as Moai-where farmers get together to share best practices and also help one another with meager harvests. In the times of distress that the farming community is in the country, can we aspire to have such kind of a group of farmers. Farmers Producers Organizations have been formed but they need to converge to the concept of Moai to make it really effective.This group also had the provision of a monthly contribution akin the idea of SELF HELP GROUPS with a difference that the contribution is utilised for social activities and left over from the contribution is given a member based on his requirements.The book has tried to assimilate other such initiatives from around the world but the bottom line is that one has to find flow in everything that one is doing.

Also, I really feel sad to see my 75 plus mom in law and 65 plus mom to see sticking to bed and complaining that they are good for nothing now. I don\u2019t want to be one of these old women who can\u2019t rejoice life anymore, I wish to have both mental and physical strength in my old age too that\u2019s why I have entertained Yoga to my daily routine.The book starts with Japanese proverb \u201cOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years\u201d and it touches the art of staying young while growing old and also shares antiaging secrets. It also recommends to find flow in everything you doand master longevity. It gives a comparison of logotherapy of psychotherapy and prefers the previous. Apart from that, the book also tells the experience tales of centenarians as how they made it upto living longer and healthier life. The diet and exercise carry an essential ingredient in a perfect recipe of life.\u201cNana Korobi Ya Oki/ Fall seven times, rise eight\u201d is the key to remain antifragile and be resilient to deal with the setbacks. Follow the philosophies of Budhism and Stoicism which aim at practicing well being while you are enjoying life\u2019s pleasures. According to stoicism, we should be able to control our emotions and curb our ego and negative emotions.I even loved the \u2018wabi sabi\u2019 and \u2018ichi-go ichi-e\u2019 concepts which tell us that instead of looking for beauty in perfection, we should look out beauty in the given things-the things that are incomplete and temporary.Although the content on Yoga is something I just skipped because these were known facts and considerations.On the whole, Ikigai is a beautiful gift to the society. It leads you from darkness to light and follow a right path to healthy lifestyle. Worry less, Walk an extra mile and Weigh your burdens less. A good diet and some sort of exercise is needed to be added. Above all, everyone must have some purpose in life.

Her lifestyle, her friend circle everything came to scrutiny during the First world war, where France labelled her as A Spy and a double agent for both France & Germany. Was she really a spy? or just a free thinking independent woman who was made a scapegoat during the most dreaded war?

The first 2 parts were in Mata Hari's own voice through her letters to her lawyer Mr. Clunet & the 3rd was in Mr. Clunet's own letters written for Mata Hari, a tricky concept which worked for this book.\u25cfThe story portrays brilliantly all the stages of Mata Hari's entire life from her childhood days in Holland to her first days in France when she was at the height of her succes and then also her last days when her name was demolished publicly.\u25cf It captures her love towards France, the very country which denied her very innocence, her so-called friends who deserted her in her need.\u25cfThe conception of love that Mata Hari coveted was so different yet honest but ultimately she couldn't understand the love of Mr. Clunet whom she accused of fighting her case half heartedly was heartbreaking.->Negative points-\u25c6The only one I could find was the story felt rushed sometimes, there were some gaps which if filled would have resulted in something as a perfect creation.Recommendation-I would urge every to read this book.

Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.#thelongestreview?", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 5 September 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "510 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

I have a Bose now but I cannot use it for longer than 2-3 hours as its heavy and ears and head start aching.This Infinity one wins there. I have used it for 6-7 hours without any aches or pains.The ear pieces do press a little on the ears unlike over-the-ear ones. This one is on-the-ear. But it is not uncomfortable and gives a good fit.The sound quality is good too. Noise cancellation is not big. With low volumes, you can hear surrounding noise.Battery does last for a long long time. I used it daily for 4-5 hours for about 3 days with one charge. Am truly impressed with it.And it folds, hence carrying it around is convenient too.And I got it in the lightning deal at 1500 Rs. Worth the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a non-expensive wireless headphones with a decent sound quality.I am giving it a 4 because I am not sure of its durability.

Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 3 September 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "11 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

I don't know on what volume they mentioned 20 hr playback. But it lasts longly.Pros: Money vise you can stick to it, but if you can spent a little more, go with JBL itself.

You get 20 hours of playback at an exceptional price. Sound output is very good, way better than Sony ZX 110. I am also using Sennheiser CX 180. Although sound quality cannot be compared to Sennheiser, but still everything is crisp and clear. No glitches whatsoever.Build quality and finishing is top notch. The sample photos posted on website are not doing justice to the real product. When i received these headphones, i was stunned. Its completely jet black having a nice circular glossy finish on the earpads. The infinity logo is also big, pronounced and looking quite sober. These are lightweight headphones. Pads are neither too soft nor too hard.Bass is pretty decent in normal mode. When i have to listen to alternative rock, progressive, bollywood and punjabi music i use the deep bass mode. It makes you feel as if you're enjoying music in the comfort of your car. Feels as if it has its own mini basstube, which is great addition to a budget headphone like this one.Fitting is good, you get a good snug fit. When i was using normal bass mode it was comfortable, not so much using deep bass mode. Kind of warms up the ears but once you get used to it, it's comfortable. Keep it at adequate volume level.Conclusion - Audio-4/5, Bass quality- 5/5 Build Quality - 4.5/5, Comfort-4/5, Battery Backup-5/5, Value for money-5/5This is a good start i feel. After using these you can upgrade to premium ones later on. Good quality headphone padding alone costs quite a bit, therefore making a good quality headphone within this 1400- 1500rs. price tag is a commendable work. These are by Harman Kardon and they justify each and every single penny you spent on it.If my review has helped you, click helpful button.

Rs 1499. My pros and cons about this headset are as below:Pros:1.No doubt in quality of sound. Good clarity.2.The sound rolls on.3.The bass is thumping even without Bass mode. There is very little difference between bass and non bass mode.4. Good Bluetooth connection5. Good Battery life , till my 3 weeks of usage, goes at least 10 hours in max volumes. I give full charge for about 2 hours, and goes for 3-4 days by using discretely 2-3 hours daily.6. Doesn't pain on ear as such. Quite comfortable compared to other on-ear headsets because of it's light weight.7. Price is low at this range.8. All functionalities of buttons work well as described in the manual.Cons:1. On the left side of the headset, where buttons are present, makes some noise when u beat little with finger or touch the keys, like 'Ting-Ting' which is quite annoying.2. Not splash proof.3. Noise Cancellation is not that good, the music can be heard from outside when at it's high volume. Though u may not be able to hear the outer noise when u hearing in to the music.4. Quality of material should have been little better. U have to be careful while taking out of your neck. Use both hands to take out and take in. May break if u use one hand to do this task.My overall comment is to go for this Headset if u have less budget and need Thumping sound that too with warranty of 1 year and brand name.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 16 September 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "2 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

{"names": "DRS", "reviewerLink": "/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHI6ZBGECQ7WTGTOURU4LLXVRRA", "reviewTitles": "This headphone was a let down. The worst is the voice lag and delayed sounds it gives.", "reviewBody": "Heres my initial experience...(as a professional video editor and avid video watcher)HEAVY AUDIO LAG : If your using this for music only, then you wont notice this. But like me if your buying this for video watching then this will be totally unusable. The transmission has a heavy delay. Voices will seem out of sync. Car doors closing sounds come after the door is closed. This is happening on YouTube and even Local movie files stored on the PC in all formats. Even tried with different players. Different devices such as phone, PC, Laptop.CHEAP TIN PLATE NOISE : Theres a sound of a tin plate doing a \"tatung\" noise each time you press any button on the headphone. As if theres a cheap tin sheet inside. At least if this noise comes only when pressing buttons its ok, we can adjust with it, BUT the noise comes even if you shake your head. Even with the headphone OFF. Theres some cheap material used inside that's causing mechanical vibration and is loose. This seems like not for only my unit, bec many members here complain of that noise. Also this \"tuuuunnng\" noise will appear even when you stop a video. Say someone on the video is talking and you just hit pause. Immediately after the sound stops you will hear the excess vibration noise, that means its vibrating throughout the video marring the sound quality slightly, only thing you dont notice its contribution except for when you stop the video you hear that its been vibrating all along. With the headphone OFF put it on your head and just loudly say HEY or AAAH. You will hear the followup whining \"tuuuuuung\" noise. WTF is this quality ? Shame on JBL and HARMON KARDON. Sound quality is one thing, you get what you pay for, but these are severe cripple/blunders which are not acceptable. A maruti cannot give you the quality of a mercedez benz, accepted. But just bec its a maruti if one wheel is missing then thats a major blunder, not quality, yes theres a difference.HIGHLY ILLOGICAL ERGONOMIC BUTTON PLACEMENT : But this issue is also manageable compared to the above mentioned problems. The power button and volume buttons etc were placed by the genius designer on the angled side. You cannot find them or press them easily without some finger flexing. Try n see. If you try to press the VOL buttons when it on your head the headphone will come off your head, because the button is on the side, when you push the whole cup will move off your ear. But this problem can be over come by practicing to operate with 1 other finger holding the opposite side for support to give counter support when pressing a button. But if trying to change to Deep Bass mode when its on your head ,,,,good luck trying. Even the LED was placed at such a position that you'll only need to hold it in your hand to see what status its blinking at, good for pairing maybe. If it was a little on the front when your wearing it, then you could easily tell by the refection in the monitor or by watching any reflective surface in your room that its active etc...but this is negligible and not a real problem.CONNECTIVITY : Very fast to connect and auto connect.RANGE : Its doesn't work for 20 meters and all that crap that you keep hearing around. Its like standard BT range, Within 1 room or just outside that room door. That's about it.FINAL VERDICT : I would love to return this (or throw it at the manufacturer's face if it were possible), but its inconvenient because due to COVID i ordered this to ship to a relatives zone, drove there and collected it (75km drive total). Now ill have to again go and give it there, trouble them to handle the returns guy, then again drive down there when a replacement comes, that too not knowing whether that replacement will solve the problem or have the same issues. My car fuel costs more than the headphones to do 2 more drives for 75km. I might as well use this a while and throw in the bin (where it belongs) and buy some other brand in the future.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 9 June 2020", "starRating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

To be very honest, this is a very nice headphone (I can't compare it with others since this is my first BT headphone). The below review is based on 2 days of use.Pro:- Sound Quality is good and clear- Bass is just right as per me even in Normal Mode. EQ mode doesn't make much difference.- Foldable and light weight (as advertised)- Good Battery Life (as advertised)- Comfort is also OK but there is always room for improvement.- I wear spects but using the headphone for longer duration doesn't give much of pain.- Receiving and making phone calls using some calling application like WhatsApp is also clear and other party can hear you very nicely so the MIC is also good.Now you would wonder, why have I mentioned taking calls using some calling application in the Pro above? The answer to that is mentioned in the Con section.Cons (Issues):- When receiving a normal phone call, neither me nor the calling party can hear each other. I have to switch to phone mode and then back to BT mode to start the conversation with the caller. This is a major problem for someone using this for phone calls.- While taking call, my headphone got disconnected and reconnected automatically thrice during a single call at an interval of approximately 10 mins each. After re connection, neither of us can hear each other. I have to switch off and switch on the BT headphone to start the conversation by keeping the caller on hold.Due to above 2 Cons, I replaced my headphone once but still the same problem. Hence raised a return for the same finally.

The easy way to ignore this is not to tap the headphone. But in my case, when i speak or someone else speaks loudly, the vibrations make that hollow sound. My ear being sensitive, I get distracted by that sound. I hope I get used to it. That's something that is not amazon /online retailer's fault. I called up Harman to ask if they knew anything about this but they were clueless too. I exchanged the first one thinking it is a 1 piece issue, but it is not. I do like the sound and battery backup. Hence, will keep second one.Full points to amazon and appario retail for immediate and hassle free exchange. I only wish this sound wouldn't be there.\u2022 Also, first one seemed very tight on ears.

Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it.

Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 3 September 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "11 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

No distortion in taking calls and decent build quality. It kinda look like jbl t460bt younger brother. I have given 4* because it has a minor issue of producing a sound like \"ting ting\" when you touch or tap right side of the headphones. But it doesn't bother that much so it's a sweet deal. Hope you can enjoy this product.Update: 27 may 2020- I have been using this for past 8 months and their sound quality is best considering it's battery life and build which is far good than other headphones available. The only one drawback is their are not much comfortable.

You get 20 hours of playback at an exceptional price. Sound output is very good, way better than Sony ZX 110. I am also using Sennheiser CX 180. Although sound quality cannot be compared to Sennheiser, but still everything is crisp and clear. No glitches whatsoever.Build quality and finishing is top notch. The sample photos posted on website are not doing justice to the real product. When i received these headphones, i was stunned. Its completely jet black having a nice circular glossy finish on the earpads. The infinity logo is also big, pronounced and looking quite sober. These are lightweight headphones. Pads are neither too soft nor too hard.Bass is pretty decent in normal mode. When i have to listen to alternative rock, progressive, bollywood and punjabi music i use the deep bass mode. It makes you feel as if you're enjoying music in the comfort of your car. Feels as if it has its own mini basstube, which is great addition to a budget headphone like this one.Fitting is good, you get a good snug fit. When i was using normal bass mode it was comfortable, not so much using deep bass mode. Kind of warms up the ears but once you get used to it, it's comfortable. Keep it at adequate volume level.Conclusion - Audio-4/5, Bass quality- 5/5 Build Quality - 4.5/5, Comfort-4/5, Battery Backup-5/5, Value for money-5/5This is a good start i feel. After using these you can upgrade to premium ones later on. Good quality headphone padding alone costs quite a bit, therefore making a good quality headphone within this 1400- 1500rs. price tag is a commendable work. These are by Harman Kardon and they justify each and every single penny you spent on it.If my review has helped you, click helpful button.

Rs 1499. My pros and cons about this headset are as below:Pros:1.No doubt in quality of sound. Good clarity.2.The sound rolls on.3.The bass is thumping even without Bass mode. There is very little difference between bass and non bass mode.4. Good Bluetooth connection5. Good Battery life , till my 3 weeks of usage, goes at least 10 hours in max volumes. I give full charge for about 2 hours, and goes for 3-4 days by using discretely 2-3 hours daily.6. Doesn't pain on ear as such. Quite comfortable compared to other on-ear headsets because of it's light weight.7. Price is low at this range.8. All functionalities of buttons work well as described in the manual.Cons:1. On the left side of the headset, where buttons are present, makes some noise when u beat little with finger or touch the keys, like 'Ting-Ting' which is quite annoying.2. Not splash proof.3. Noise Cancellation is not that good, the music can be heard from outside when at it's high volume. Though u may not be able to hear the outer noise when u hearing in to the music.4. Quality of material should have been little better. U have to be careful while taking out of your neck. Use both hands to take out and take in. May break if u use one hand to do this task.My overall comment is to go for this Headset if u have less budget and need Thumping sound that too with warranty of 1 year and brand name.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 16 September 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "2 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

{"names": "DRS", "reviewerLink": "/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHI6ZBGECQ7WTGTOURU4LLXVRRA", "reviewTitles": "This headphone was a let down. The worst is the voice lag and delayed sounds it gives.", "reviewBody": "Heres my initial experience...(as a professional video editor and avid video watcher)HEAVY AUDIO LAG : If your using this for music only, then you wont notice this. But like me if your buying this for video watching then this will be totally unusable. The transmission has a heavy delay. Voices will seem out of sync. Car doors closing sounds come after the door is closed. This is happening on YouTube and even Local movie files stored on the PC in all formats. Even tried with different players. Different devices such as phone, PC, Laptop.CHEAP TIN PLATE NOISE : Theres a sound of a tin plate doing a \"tatung\" noise each time you press any button on the headphone. As if theres a cheap tin sheet inside. At least if this noise comes only when pressing buttons its ok, we can adjust with it, BUT the noise comes even if you shake your head. Even with the headphone OFF. Theres some cheap material used inside that's causing mechanical vibration and is loose. This seems like not for only my unit, bec many members here complain of that noise. Also this \"tuuuunnng\" noise will appear even when you stop a video. Say someone on the video is talking and you just hit pause. Immediately after the sound stops you will hear the excess vibration noise, that means its vibrating throughout the video marring the sound quality slightly, only thing you dont notice its contribution except for when you stop the video you hear that its been vibrating all along. With the headphone OFF put it on your head and just loudly say HEY or AAAH. You will hear the followup whining \"tuuuuuung\" noise. WTF is this quality ? Shame on JBL and HARMON KARDON. Sound quality is one thing, you get what you pay for, but these are severe cripple/blunders which are not acceptable. A maruti cannot give you the quality of a mercedez benz, accepted. But just bec its a maruti if one wheel is missing then thats a major blunder, not quality, yes theres a difference.HIGHLY ILLOGICAL ERGONOMIC BUTTON PLACEMENT : But this issue is also manageable compared to the above mentioned problems. The power button and volume buttons etc were placed by the genius designer on the angled side. You cannot find them or press them easily without some finger flexing. Try n see. If you try to press the VOL buttons when it on your head the headphone will come off your head, because the button is on the side, when you push the whole cup will move off your ear. But this problem can be over come by practicing to operate with 1 other finger holding the opposite side for support to give counter support when pressing a button. But if trying to change to Deep Bass mode when its on your head ,,,,good luck trying. Even the LED was placed at such a position that you'll only need to hold it in your hand to see what status its blinking at, good for pairing maybe. If it was a little on the front when your wearing it, then you could easily tell by the refection in the monitor or by watching any reflective surface in your room that its active etc...but this is negligible and not a real problem.CONNECTIVITY : Very fast to connect and auto connect.RANGE : Its doesn't work for 20 meters and all that crap that you keep hearing around. Its like standard BT range, Within 1 room or just outside that room door. That's about it.FINAL VERDICT : I would love to return this (or throw it at the manufacturer's face if it were possible), but its inconvenient because due to COVID i ordered this to ship to a relatives zone, drove there and collected it (75km drive total).

To be very honest, this is a very nice headphone (I can't compare it with others since this is my first BT headphone). The below review is based on 2 days of use.Pro:- Sound Quality is good and clear- Bass is just right as per me even in Normal Mode. EQ mode doesn't make much difference.- Foldable and light weight (as advertised)- Good Battery Life (as advertised)- Comfort is also OK but there is always room for improvement.- I wear spects but using the headphone for longer duration doesn't give much of pain.- Receiving and making phone calls using some calling application like WhatsApp is also clear and other party can hear you very nicely so the MIC is also good.Now you would wonder, why have I mentioned taking calls using some calling application in the Pro above? The answer to that is mentioned in the Con section.Cons (Issues):- When receiving a normal phone call, neither me nor the calling party can hear each other. I have to switch to phone mode and then back to BT mode to start the conversation with the caller. This is a major problem for someone using this for phone calls.- While taking call, my headphone got disconnected and reconnected automatically thrice during a single call at an interval of approximately 10 mins each. After re connection, neither of us can hear each other. I have to switch off and switch on the BT headphone to start the conversation by keeping the caller on hold.Due to above 2 Cons, I replaced my headphone once but still the same problem.

Highs are also fantastic. As of my research, I noticed the concept of \"Binaural Beats\" which was going on in the sound it produced. I recommend you searching \"Binaural Beats\" in Google. This generates a kind of Binaural Effect(3D audio) as an output, which I felt somewhat. This is done by VLC in their software. So, I recommend you use the VLC media player with the equaliser set to Headphones. This enhances the sound's liveliness. This was my research with this headphone. Hope it is useful. Just go for it.. This product is gonna satisfy you..

No cushion in head band but not a deal breaker on comfort. 2way Folding earpads improve the handling and storing.My verdict:So if you are a music enthusiast who craves and well understands the richness of music quality, look for other options at higher budget.If budget constraints and usage is mostly movies/tv and calls i.e general purpose, then you can consider it.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 26 May 2020", "starRating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it.

Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 3 September 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "11 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

The delivery was good. Now to the headphones,this headphones has all the things you need to called this headphone. I mean the sound quality is excellent. Bass is good. No distortion in taking calls and decent build quality. It kinda look like jbl t460bt younger brother. I have given 4* because it has a minor issue of producing a sound like \"ting ting\" when you touch or tap right side of the headphones. But it doesn't bother that much so it's a sweet deal. Hope you can enjoy this product.Update: 27 may 2020- I have been using this for past 8 months and their sound quality is best considering it's battery life and build which is far good than other headphones available. The only one drawback is their are not much comfortable.

You get 20 hours of playback at an exceptional price. Sound output is very good, way better than Sony ZX 110. I am also using Sennheiser CX 180. Although sound quality cannot be compared to Sennheiser, but still everything is crisp and clear. No glitches whatsoever.Build quality and finishing is top notch. The sample photos posted on website are not doing justice to the real product. When i received these headphones, i was stunned. Its completely jet black having a nice circular glossy finish on the earpads. The infinity logo is also big, pronounced and looking quite sober. These are lightweight headphones. Pads are neither too soft nor too hard.Bass is pretty decent in normal mode. When i have to listen to alternative rock, progressive, bollywood and punjabi music i use the deep bass mode. It makes you feel as if you're enjoying music in the comfort of your car. Feels as if it has its own mini basstube, which is great addition to a budget headphone like this one.Fitting is good, you get a good snug fit. When i was using normal bass mode it was comfortable, not so much using deep bass mode. Kind of warms up the ears but once you get used to it, it's comfortable. Keep it at adequate volume level.Conclusion - Audio-4/5, Bass quality- 5/5 Build Quality - 4.5/5, Comfort-4/5, Battery Backup-5/5, Value for money-5/5This is a good start i feel. After using these you can upgrade to premium ones later on. Good quality headphone padding alone costs quite a bit, therefore making a good quality headphone within this 1400- 1500rs. price tag is a commendable work. These are by Harman Kardon and they justify each and every single penny you spent on it.If my review has helped you, click helpful button.

Rs 1499. My pros and cons about this headset are as below:Pros:1.No doubt in quality of sound. Good clarity.2.The sound rolls on.3.The bass is thumping even without Bass mode. There is very little difference between bass and non bass mode.4. Good Bluetooth connection5. Good Battery life , till my 3 weeks of usage, goes at least 10 hours in max volumes. I give full charge for about 2 hours, and goes for 3-4 days by using discretely 2-3 hours daily.6. Doesn't pain on ear as such. Quite comfortable compared to other on-ear headsets because of it's light weight.7. Price is low at this range.8. All functionalities of buttons work well as described in the manual.Cons:1. On the left side of the headset, where buttons are present, makes some noise when u beat little with finger or touch the keys, like 'Ting-Ting' which is quite annoying.2. Not splash proof.3. Noise Cancellation is not that good, the music can be heard from outside when at it's high volume. Though u may not be able to hear the outer noise when u hearing in to the music.4. Quality of material should have been little better. U have to be careful while taking out of your neck. Use both hands to take out and take in. May break if u use one hand to do this task.My overall comment is to go for this Headset if u have less budget and need Thumping sound that too with warranty of 1 year and brand name.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 16 September 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "2 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

The worst is the voice lag and delayed sounds it gives.", "reviewBody": "Heres my initial experience...(as a professional video editor and avid video watcher)HEAVY AUDIO LAG : If your using this for music only, then you wont notice this. But like me if your buying this for video watching then this will be totally unusable. The transmission has a heavy delay. Voices will seem out of sync. Car doors closing sounds come after the door is closed. This is happening on YouTube and even Local movie files stored on the PC in all formats. Even tried with different players. Different devices such as phone, PC, Laptop.CHEAP TIN PLATE NOISE : Theres a sound of a tin plate doing a \"tatung\" noise each time you press any button on the headphone. As if theres a cheap tin sheet inside. At least if this noise comes only when pressing buttons its ok, we can adjust with it, BUT the noise comes even if you shake your head. Even with the headphone OFF. Theres some cheap material used inside that's causing mechanical vibration and is loose. This seems like not for only my unit, bec many members here complain of that noise. Also this \"tuuuunnng\" noise will appear even when you stop a video. Say someone on the video is talking and you just hit pause. Immediately after the sound stops you will hear the excess vibration noise, that means its vibrating throughout the video marring the sound quality slightly, only thing you dont notice its contribution except for when you stop the video you hear that its been vibrating all along. With the headphone OFF put it on your head and just loudly say HEY or AAAH. You will hear the followup whining \"tuuuuuung\" noise. WTF is this quality ? Shame on JBL and HARMON KARDON. Sound quality is one thing, you get what you pay for, but these are severe cripple/blunders which are not acceptable. A maruti cannot give you the quality of a mercedez benz, accepted. But just bec its a maruti if one wheel is missing then thats a major blunder, not quality, yes theres a difference.HIGHLY ILLOGICAL ERGONOMIC BUTTON PLACEMENT : But this issue is also manageable compared to the above mentioned problems. The power button and volume buttons etc were placed by the genius designer on the angled side. You cannot find them or press them easily without some finger flexing. Try n see. If you try to press the VOL buttons when it on your head the headphone will come off your head, because the button is on the side, when you push the whole cup will move off your ear. But this problem can be over come by practicing to operate with 1 other finger holding the opposite side for support to give counter support when pressing a button. But if trying to change to Deep Bass mode when its on your head ,,,,good luck trying. Even the LED was placed at such a position that you'll only need to hold it in your hand to see what status its blinking at, good for pairing maybe. If it was a little on the front when your wearing it, then you could easily tell by the refection in the monitor or by watching any reflective surface in your room that its active etc...but this is negligible and not a real problem.CONNECTIVITY : Very fast to connect and auto connect.RANGE : Its doesn't work for 20 meters and all that crap that you keep hearing around. Its like standard BT range, Within 1 room or just outside that room door. That's about it.FINAL VERDICT : I would love to return this (or throw it at the manufacturer's face if it were possible), but its inconvenient because due to COVID i ordered this to ship to a relatives zone, drove there and collected it (75km drive total). Now ill have to again go and give it there, trouble them to handle the returns guy, then again drive down there when a replacement comes, that too not knowing whether that replacement will solve the problem or have the same issues. My car fuel costs more than the headphones to do 2 more drives for 75km. I might as well use this a while and throw in the bin (where it belongs) and buy some other brand in the future.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 9 June 2020", "starRating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

To be very honest, this is a very nice headphone (I can't compare it with others since this is my first BT headphone). The below review is based on 2 days of use.Pro:- Sound Quality is good and clear- Bass is just right as per me even in Normal Mode. EQ mode doesn't make much difference.- Foldable and light weight (as advertised)- Good Battery Life (as advertised)- Comfort is also OK but there is always room for improvement.- I wear spects but using the headphone for longer duration doesn't give much of pain.- Receiving and making phone calls using some calling application like WhatsApp is also clear and other party can hear you very nicely so the MIC is also good.Now you would wonder, why have I mentioned taking calls using some calling application in the Pro above? The answer to that is mentioned in the Con section.Cons (Issues):- When receiving a normal phone call, neither me nor the calling party can hear each other. I have to switch to phone mode and then back to BT mode to start the conversation with the caller. This is a major problem for someone using this for phone calls.- While taking call, my headphone got disconnected and reconnected automatically thrice during a single call at an interval of approximately 10 mins each. After re connection, neither of us can hear each other. I have to switch off and switch on the BT headphone to start the conversation by keeping the caller on hold.Due to above 2 Cons, I replaced my headphone once but still the same problem.

I tested this headphone with the app 'function generator' to test how it manages the different frequencies. But it did well. As of lows, I managed to hear the sound till 7.5Hz(the lowest frequency). Highs are also fantastic. As of my research, I noticed the concept of \"Binaural Beats\" which was going on in the sound it produced. I recommend you searching \"Binaural Beats\" in Google. This generates a kind of Binaural Effect(3D audio) as an output, which I felt somewhat. This is done by VLC in their software. So, I recommend you use the VLC media player with the equaliser set to Headphones. This enhances the sound's liveliness. This was my research with this headphone. Hope it is useful. Just go for it..

Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it.

Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 3 September 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "11 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

You get 20 hours of playback at an exceptional price. Sound output is very good, way better than Sony ZX 110. I am also using Sennheiser CX 180. Although sound quality cannot be compared to Sennheiser, but still everything is crisp and clear. No glitches whatsoever.Build quality and finishing is top notch. The sample photos posted on website are not doing justice to the real product. When i received these headphones, i was stunned. Its completely jet black having a nice circular glossy finish on the earpads. The infinity logo is also big, pronounced and looking quite sober. These are lightweight headphones. Pads are neither too soft nor too hard.Bass is pretty decent in normal mode. When i have to listen to alternative rock, progressive, bollywood and punjabi music i use the deep bass mode. It makes you feel as if you're enjoying music in the comfort of your car. Feels as if it has its own mini basstube, which is great addition to a budget headphone like this one.Fitting is good, you get a good snug fit. When i was using normal bass mode it was comfortable, not so much using deep bass mode. Kind of warms up the ears but once you get used to it, it's comfortable. Keep it at adequate volume level.Conclusion - Audio-4/5, Bass quality- 5/5 Build Quality - 4.5/5, Comfort-4/5, Battery Backup-5/5, Value for money-5/5This is a good start i feel. After using these you can upgrade to premium ones later on. Good quality headphone padding alone costs quite a bit, therefore making a good quality headphone within this 1400- 1500rs. price tag is a commendable work. These are by Harman Kardon and they justify each and every single penny you spent on it.If my review has helped you, click helpful button.

Rs 1499. My pros and cons about this headset are as below:Pros:1.No doubt in quality of sound. Good clarity.2.The sound rolls on.3.The bass is thumping even without Bass mode. There is very little difference between bass and non bass mode.4. Good Bluetooth connection5. Good Battery life , till my 3 weeks of usage, goes at least 10 hours in max volumes. I give full charge for about 2 hours, and goes for 3-4 days by using discretely 2-3 hours daily.6. Doesn't pain on ear as such. Quite comfortable compared to other on-ear headsets because of it's light weight.7. Price is low at this range.8. All functionalities of buttons work well as described in the manual.Cons:1. On the left side of the headset, where buttons are present, makes some noise when u beat little with finger or touch the keys, like 'Ting-Ting' which is quite annoying.2. Not splash proof.3. Noise Cancellation is not that good, the music can be heard from outside when at it's high volume. Though u may not be able to hear the outer noise when u hearing in to the music.4. Quality of material should have been little better. U have to be careful while taking out of your neck. Use both hands to take out and take in. May break if u use one hand to do this task.My overall comment is to go for this Headset if u have less budget and need Thumping sound that too with warranty of 1 year and brand name.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 16 September 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "2 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

The worst is the voice lag and delayed sounds it gives.", "reviewBody": "Heres my initial experience...(as a professional video editor and avid video watcher)HEAVY AUDIO LAG : If your using this for music only, then you wont notice this. But like me if your buying this for video watching then this will be totally unusable. The transmission has a heavy delay. Voices will seem out of sync. Car doors closing sounds come after the door is closed. This is happening on YouTube and even Local movie files stored on the PC in all formats. Even tried with different players. Different devices such as phone, PC, Laptop.CHEAP TIN PLATE NOISE : Theres a sound of a tin plate doing a \"tatung\" noise each time you press any button on the headphone. As if theres a cheap tin sheet inside. At least if this noise comes only when pressing buttons its ok, we can adjust with it, BUT the noise comes even if you shake your head. Even with the headphone OFF. Theres some cheap material used inside that's causing mechanical vibration and is loose. This seems like not for only my unit, bec many members here complain of that noise. Also this \"tuuuunnng\" noise will appear even when you stop a video. Say someone on the video is talking and you just hit pause. Immediately after the sound stops you will hear the excess vibration noise, that means its vibrating throughout the video marring the sound quality slightly, only thing you dont notice its contribution except for when you stop the video you hear that its been vibrating all along. With the headphone OFF put it on your head and just loudly say HEY or AAAH. You will hear the followup whining \"tuuuuuung\" noise. WTF is this quality ? Shame on JBL and HARMON KARDON. Sound quality is one thing, you get what you pay for, but these are severe cripple/blunders which are not acceptable. A maruti cannot give you the quality of a mercedez benz, accepted. But just bec its a maruti if one wheel is missing then thats a major blunder, not quality, yes theres a difference.HIGHLY ILLOGICAL ERGONOMIC BUTTON PLACEMENT : But this issue is also manageable compared to the above mentioned problems. The power button and volume buttons etc were placed by the genius designer on the angled side. You cannot find them or press them easily without some finger flexing. Try n see. If you try to press the VOL buttons when it on your head the headphone will come off your head, because the button is on the side, when you push the whole cup will move off your ear. But this problem can be over come by practicing to operate with 1 other finger holding the opposite side for support to give counter support when pressing a button. But if trying to change to Deep Bass mode when its on your head ,,,,good luck trying. Even the LED was placed at such a position that you'll only need to hold it in your hand to see what status its blinking at, good for pairing maybe. If it was a little on the front when your wearing it, then you could easily tell by the refection in the monitor or by watching any reflective surface in your room that its active etc...but this is negligible and not a real problem.CONNECTIVITY : Very fast to connect and auto connect.RANGE : Its doesn't work for 20 meters and all that crap that you keep hearing around. Its like standard BT range, Within 1 room or just outside that room door. That's about it.FINAL VERDICT : I would love to return this (or throw it at the manufacturer's face if it were possible), but its inconvenient because due to COVID i ordered this to ship to a relatives zone, drove there and collected it (75km drive total). Now ill have to again go and give it there, trouble them to handle the returns guy, then again drive down there when a replacement comes, that too not knowing whether that replacement will solve the problem or have the same issues. My car fuel costs more than the headphones to do 2 more drives for 75km. I might as well use this a while and throw in the bin (where it belongs) and buy some other brand in the future.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 9 June 2020", "starRating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

There is not much noise cancellation and to be fair it does not make any noise cancellation claims either. Battery backup is definitely good and no issues with charging. Boat vs JBL is a tough call.

EQ mode doesn't make much difference.- Foldable and light weight (as advertised)- Good Battery Life (as advertised)- Comfort is also OK but there is always room for improvement.- I wear spects but using the headphone for longer duration doesn't give much of pain.- Receiving and making phone calls using some calling application like WhatsApp is also clear and other party can hear you very nicely so the MIC is also good.Now you would wonder, why have I mentioned taking calls using some calling application in the Pro above? The answer to that is mentioned in the Con section.Cons (Issues):- When receiving a normal phone call, neither me nor the calling party can hear each other. I have to switch to phone mode and then back to BT mode to start the conversation with the caller. This is a major problem for someone using this for phone calls.- While taking call, my headphone got disconnected and reconnected automatically thrice during a single call at an interval of approximately 10 mins each. After re connection, neither of us can hear each other. I have to switch off and switch on the BT headphone to start the conversation by keeping the caller on hold.Due to above 2 Cons, I replaced my headphone once but still the same problem. Hence raised a return for the same finally. Due to above 2 issues, I have rated this headphone a 2 star because, according to me, these 2 issues are a DEAL BREAKER.Request to Team Infinity - Kindly look into the above 2 issues mentioned and provide some suggestion.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 15 December 2019", "starRating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

I tested this headphone with the app 'function generator' to test how it manages the different frequencies. But it did well. As of lows, I managed to hear the sound till 7.5Hz(the lowest frequency). Highs are also fantastic. As of my research, I noticed the concept of \"Binaural Beats\" which was going on in the sound it produced. I recommend you searching \"Binaural Beats\" in Google. This generates a kind of Binaural Effect(3D audio) as an output, which I felt somewhat. This is done by VLC in their software. So, I recommend you use the VLC media player with the equaliser set to Headphones. This enhances the sound's liveliness. This was my research with this headphone. Hope it is useful. Just go for it.. This product is gonna satisfy you..

Buttons lack operational aesthetics.Music Quality - average \"hi-fi\"ness or richness of sound. Loudness is good. Bass is ok. Treble is below average. The sound quality feels to be blocked somewhere. Though not a shocker at this price range but still could have been better as it's a Harman product.Call quality is decent. Battery life is impressive.Comfort - Ear pads are well cushioned hence shouldn't cause much problem even if worn for 2-3 hours straight. Also they fit well and comfortably tight, so could be used with exercises or jogging. No cushion in head band but not a deal breaker on comfort. 2way Folding earpads improve the handling and storing.My verdict:So if you are a music enthusiast who craves and well understands the richness of music quality, look for other options at higher budget.If budget constraints and usage is mostly movies/tv and calls i.e general purpose, then you can consider it.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in India on 26 May 2020", "starRating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "One person found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Infinity-Glide-500-Wireless-Headphones/product-reviews/B07W5MYRF4?pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"}
