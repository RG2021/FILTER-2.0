# Amazon Fake Reviews Filter

## Introduction
* This project primarily focuses on how to improve the current shopping experience of the customers that buys online in such a way that they donâ€™t have to think twice for the legitimacy of a product mentioned online. 

* I have created a web interference where the customers can input the link to the product that they are planning to purchase and then within minutes they will get a full report of the product legitimacy as whether a product is as good or bad as mentioned online along with the feature wise ratings of it. 

* I have made use of the concepts of Natural Language Processing and Web Scarping that extracts all the reviews data and filters out the Fake reviews from it and then ranks the remaining authentic reviews in a such a manner that a customer will get to see the most helpful reviews first out of hundreds or thousands of reviews and also gets a feature wise rating report helping them to make a better purchase decision.

* I have tried to develop an Web Interface inspired by fakespot.com such when a user comes onto my website then all they have to do is input the URL for the product that they are planning to purchase and then in approx. 2 minutes they will get a full report to their product that contains the following,

  * True Rating of product after removal of Fake Reviews
  * Top Positive and Top Negative Authentic review.
  * Feature Wise Rating for the product, like what are the views of people about a particular feature of     the product instead of the whole product.
  * Top 50 most Helpful and Authentic reviews eliminating the need for the customer to scroll down for       every review that best explains the product.
